      summary: Set up a new password for the user
      description: >
        This endpoint is used to set a new password for a user. It requires a token (from the password reset link) and a new password. The new password is hashed before it's updated in the user's account. If the password update is successful, a success message is returned. If there's an error, it's caught and an error message is returned.
